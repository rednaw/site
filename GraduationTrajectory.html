        <strong>Title:</strong> MoL Graduation Trajectory<br />
        <strong>Programme:</strong>
        <a href="https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl">Master of Logic (MoL)</a><br />
        <strong>Coordinator:</strong>

      <h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the MoL graduation trajectory is to provide 2nd year MoL
        students information and extra support in their final year. It includes
        a number of <strong>information meetings</strong> (on MoL graduation
        procedure, PhD applications, life after ILLC), some
        <strong>trainings</strong> (how to write a cv/research proposal, how to
        write a MoL thesis), and
        <strong>ILLC research units presentations</strong>, 3 sessions where the
        ILLC research units present themselves to the graduating students. The
        aim of these sessions is to give students an illustration of the topics
        ILLC researchers are currently working on and which could lead to open
        questions to be addressed in a MSc thesis. The trajectory further
        includes two kinds of <strong>student presentations</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          MoL thesis presentations (mandatory for graduating students, where
          students present their ongoing thesis project to the ILLC community)
        </li>
        <li>
          January presentations (more informal where students present their
          thesis topic to each other)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        NOTE: The trajectory is designed for 2nd year MoL students who intend to
        graduate in the second semester. But also for students starting their
        thesis writing semester in September, who intend to graduate in the
        first semester. Students from other cohorts or Logic Year students are
        also welcome to attend the sessions (in particular the research units
        presentations). Also 2nd year students who intend to take an extra
        semester can follow the trajectory this year [advisable for those
        components that will come too late for them next year such as the
        research seminars, the January presentations, how to write a MoL thesis]
        but will have to do their MoL thesis presentation in the next fall.
