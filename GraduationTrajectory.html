      <h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the MoL graduation trajectory is to provide 2nd year MoL
        students information and extra support in their final year.
      </p>

      <p>The trajectory will include two kinds of student presentations:</p>

      <p>
        MoL thesis presentations (mandatory for graduating students, where
        students present their ongoing thesis project to the ILLC community)
      </p>

      <p>
        January presentations (more informal where students present their thesis
        topic to each other)
      </p>

      <p>
        and a number of information meetings (on MoL graduation procedure, PhD
        applications, life after ILLC), some trainings (how to write a
        cv/research proposal (TBC), how to write a MoL thesis), and also 3
        sessions where the 6 ILLC research units will present themselves to the
        graduating students. The aim of these sessions is to give students an
        illustration of the topics the six groups are currently working on and
        which could lead to open questions to be addressed in a MoL thesis.
      </p>

      <p>
        NOTE: The trajectory is designed for 2nd year MoL students who intend to
        graduate in the summer of the current academic year. But also for
        students starting their thesis writing semester now, who intend to
        graduate in the winter. Students from other cohorts or Logic Year
        students are also welcome to attend the sessions (in particular the
        research seminars). Also 2nd year students who intend to take an extra
        semester can follow the trajectory this year [advisable for those
        components that will come too late for them next year such as the
        research seminars, the January presentations, how to write a MoL thesis]
        but will have to do their MoL thesis presentation in Fall 2024.
