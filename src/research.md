      People can and do infer information above and beyond what other people actually say.  Focusing on expressions with indefinite reference, this research project studies how these inferences based on language use can become part of literal meaning in historical processes of conventionalizations.
      To this aim the project includes a number of synchronic and diachronic studies of indefinite words in various languages and  develops formal models of their variation in meaning and use.

      The idea at the heart of this project is that semantic
      structures normally held to play a role in the analysis
      of questions and focus may enter the recursive
      characterization of the semantics of a much wider range
      of natural language expressions including free choice
      indefinites, disjunctions, modals, imperatives.

      The thesis (winner of the <a href=
        "http://folli.loria.fr/content/beth.php">E. W. Beth Dissertation
      Prize</a> in 2002) is about  quantification
      in intensional contexts like questions,
      propositional attitude reports and epistemic sentences.
      First it is observed that our evaluation of these
      constructions crucially depends on the way in which the
      relevant objects are identified in the specific
      circumstances of the utterance. This contextual
      dependence is then made formally precise by
      representing different methods of identification and by
      relativizing interpretation to these methods. In this
      way the thesis succeeds in giving a uniform solution to
      three (old and recent) important problems of the theory
      of interpretation -- the problem of the representation
      of the cognitive significance of identity questions,
      the logico-philosophical puzzle of <em>de re</em>
      belief ascriptions, and the technical problem of the
      combination of dynamic quantifiers with `holistic'
      notions, like presupposition, modals, or support. In
      the final chapter of the thesis, this solution is
      adapted to recent pragmatic developments in optimality
      theoretic and game-theoretic interpretation.
