## Quickstart

This project generates HTML for https://www.marialoni.org

 The most important directories and files are:
- **content** All content (web text and bibliographies) goes here
- **resources** All resources (pdfs) go here
- **_include/contact.md** contact information

After initial setup (see below) changes are done in three steps:
1. **Make changes** by editing content and/or adding resources.
    
    Content pages are written in Markdown, see the [basic syntax guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for a quick overview. **Note** It is not mandatory to use Markdown, it is also fine to just write plain HTML. With some restrictions it is even possible to mix the two in one file.
2. **Preview:** in a terminal type `rake preview` and go to http://localhost:4000/.
    
    It is not mandatory but recommended to do a preview before publishing because it is possible that a small unnoticed typo causes the site generation to fail after which your changes will not be published. 
3. **Publish** in a terminal type `rake publish`.
    
    This will take care that your changes are committed to version control and your changes are made public.

## Local setup

#### System wide setup, one time only, as user with administrator privileges.
- [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Use Homebrew to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- Use Homebrew to [install Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation)

For Linux the equivalent using apt, yum, emerge etc.

#### Local setup, one time only, as regular user.
- Use Rbenv to [install Ruby](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions) (version 2.6 or higher)
- Use Ruby to [install Bundler](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-gems)

#### Project developent setup, as regular user.
- Use Git to [clone https://github.com/marialoni/site](https://github.com/marialoni/site)
- Use Bundler to [download project dependencies](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-install.1.html)

If all went well you can now run `rake preview` and see the result on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Deployment

This site:
- is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as web framework
- uses [Jekyll-Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar#readme), a Jekyll extension for parsing BibTex files.

Publishing a Jekyll site constists of 2 steps: `build` (generate HTML) and `deploy` (publish HTML)

Out-of-the-box Jekyll with GitHub Pages only allows for fully automated publishing when using a [limited, white-listed, set of Jekyll extensions](https://pages.github.com/versions/). Sites requiring non white-listed Jekyll extensions such as Jekyll-Scholar need to implement their publishing steps themselves.

A common way of doing that is by creating a CI pipeline using something like [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) or [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/). There are a number of [Jekyll related actions in the GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?query=jekyll) that help with this. In general CI pipelines are indispensible tools for collaborative projects, they do however come with the cost of added complexity and maintenance.

 This site generator needs to be as low maintenance as possible for as long as possible. For this reason it uses the simplest possible way for publishing a Jekyll site: generate the HTML locally and then push the generated HTML to the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repository. 

All logic is implemented as a series of [Rake tasks](https://github.com/ruby/rake):
- `rake build` generates HTML
- `rake preview` generates HTML and launches a webserver for preview on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- `rake publish` generates HTML and pushes it to the main branch of [https://github.com/marialoni/marialoni.github.io](https://github.com/marialoni/marialoni.github.io)
