        People often reason contrary to the prescriptions of classical logic. In
        this project we study cases of divergence between human and
        logical-mathematical reasoning and, challenging the canonical view, we
        hypothesise that they are a straightforward consequence of a tendency in
        human cognition to neglect empty representations (neglect-zero). We
        develop logics which formally represent the neglect-zero tendency and
        rigorously study its impact on interpretation; explore possible
        conventionalizations of neglect-zero effects in specific linguistic
        domains; and experimentally investigate the impact of neglect-zero in
        ordinary reasoning and its conjectured suspension for example in the
        context of a mathematical proof.

            People can and do infer information above and beyond what other
            people actually say. Focusing on expressions with indefinite
            reference, this research project studies how these inferences based
            on language use can become part of literal meaning in historical
            processes of conventionalizations. To this aim the project includes
            a number of synchronic and diachronic studies of indefinite words in
            various languages and develops formal models of their variation in
            meaning and use.

            The idea at the heart of this project is that semantic structures
            normally held to play a role in the analysis of questions and focus
            may enter the recursive characterization of the semantics of a much
            wider range of natural language expressions including free choice
            indefinites, disjunctions, modals, imperatives.

        The thesis (winner of the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize in 2002) is
        about quantification in intensional contexts like questions,
        propositional attitude reports and epistemic sentences. First it is
        observed that our evaluation of these constructions crucially depends on
        the way in which the relevant objects are identified in the specific
        circumstances of the utterance. This contextual dependence is then made
        formally precise by representing different methods of identification and
        by relativizing interpretation to these methods. In this way the thesis
        succeeds in giving a uniform solution to three (old and recent)
        important problems of the theory of interpretation – the problem of the
        representation of the cognitive significance of identity questions, the
        logico-philosophical puzzle of <em>de re</em> belief ascriptions, and
        the technical problem of the combination of dynamic quantifiers with
        ‘holistic’ notions, like presupposition, modals, or support. In the
        final chapter of the thesis, this solution is adapted to recent
        pragmatic developments in optimality theoretic and game-theoretic
        interpretation.
